.Reports on Computer Systems Technology
The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) promotes the U.S.
economy and public welfare by providing technical leadership for
the Nation's measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops
tests, test methods, reference data, proof of concept
implementations, and technical analyses to advance the development
and productive use of information technology. ITL's
responsibilities include the development of management,
administrative, technical, and physical standards and guidelines
for the cost-effective security and privacy of other than national
security-related information in federal information systems. The
Special Publication 800-series reports on ITL's research,
guidelines, and outreach efforts in information system security,
and its collaborative activities with industry, government, and
academic organizations.
