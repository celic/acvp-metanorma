2.  Abstract

   This document defines the JSON schema for testing Secure Hash
   Algorithm (SHA) implementations with the ACVP specification.

3.  Introduction

   The Automated Crypto Validation Protocol (ACVP) defines a mechanism
   to automatically verify the cryptographic implementation of a
   software or hardware crypto module.  The ACVP specification defines
   how a crypto module communicates with an ACVP server, including
   crypto capabilities negotiation, session management, authentication,
   vector processing and more.  The ACVP specification does not define
   algorithm specific JSON constructs for performing the crypto
   validation.  A series of ACVP sub-specifications define the
   constructs for testing individual crypto algorithms.  Each sub-
   specification addresses a specific class of crypto algorithms.  This
   sub-specification defines the JSON constructs for testing Secure Hash
   Algorithm (SHA) implementations using ACVP.

4.  Terms and definitions

   No terms and definitions are listed in this document.

5.  Supported Hash Algorithms

   The following hash algorithms MAY be advertised by the ACVP compliant
   cryptographic module:

   *  SHA-1

   *  SHA2-224

   *  SHA2-256

   *  SHA2-384

   *  SHA2-512

   *  SHA2-512/224

   *  SHA2-512/256

6.  Test Types and Test Coverage

   This section describes the design of the tests used to validate
   implementations of SHA-1 and SHA-2.

6.1.  Test Types

   There are two types of tests for SHA-1 and SHA-2: functional tests
   and Monte Carlo tests.  Each has a specific value to be used in the
   testType field.  The testType field definitions are:

   *  "AFT" - Algorithm Functional Test.  These tests can be processed
      by the client using a normal 'hash' operation.  AFTs cause the
      implementation under test to exercise nomral operations on a
      single block, multiple blocks, or partial blocks.  In all
      cases,random data is used.  The functional tests are designed to
      verify that the logical components of the hash function (block
      chunking, block padding etc.) are operating correctly.

   *  "MCT" - Monte Carlo Test.  These tests exercise the implementation
      under test under stenuous circumstances.  The implementation under
      test must process the test vectors according to the correct
      algorithm and mode in this document.  MCTs can help detect
      potential memory leaks over time, and problems in allocation of
      resources, addressing variables, error handling, and generally
      improper behavior in response to random inputs.  Each MCT
      processes 100 pseudorandom tests.  Each algorithm and mode SHOULD
      have at least one MCT group.  See Section 6.2 for implementation
      details.

6.2.  Monte Carlo tests for SHA-1 and SHA-2

   The MCTs start with an initial condition (SEED which is a single
   message) and perform a series of chained computations.

   The algorithm is shown in Figure 1.

              For j = 0 to 99
              MD[0] = MD[1] = MD[2] = SEED
                  For i = 3 to 1003
                      MSG[i] = MD[i-3] || MD[i-2] || MD[i-1]
                      MD[i] = SHA(MSG[i])
                  Output MD[1002]

                 Figure 1: SHA-1 and SHA-2 Monte Carlo Test

6.3.  Test Coverage

   The tests described in this document have the intention of ensuring
   an implementation is conformant to [FIPS180-4].

6.3.1.  SHA Requirements Covered

   Sections 3 and 4 in [FIPS180-4] outline the core functions used
   within the hash algorithms.  Normal AFTs test these operations.

   Section 5 outlines the hash function preprocessing.  It is worth
   noting that not all test cases will cover the message padding
   process, but through the entire vector set, this operation will be
   fully tested.

6.3.2.  SHA Requirements Not Covered

   Section 1 in [FIPS180-4] outlines the maximum message sizes for each
   hash function.  Due to the large size (either 2^64 or 2^128 bits) of
   these maximums, they are not tested by this specification.

   Section 7 outlines digest truncation for applications where a
   shortened digest is needed.  These operations are not tested via this
   specification.

7.  Capabilities Registration

   ACVP requires crypto modules to register their capabilities.  This
   allows the crypto module to advertise support for specific
   algorithms, notifying the ACVP server which algorithms need test
   vectors generated for the validation process.  This section describes
   the constructs for advertising support of SHA algorithms to the ACVP
   server.

   The algorithm capabilities MUST be advertised as JSON objects within
   the 'algorithms' value of the ACVP registration message.  The
   'algorithms' value is an array, where each array element is an
   individual JSON object defined in this section.  The 'algorithms'
   value is part of the 'capability_exchange' element of the ACVP JSON
   registration message.  See the ACVP specification [ACVP] for more
   details on the registration message.

7.1.  Prerequisites

   Each algorithm implementation MAY rely on other cryptographic
   primitives.  For example, RSA Signature algorithms depend on an
   underlying hash function.  Each of these underlying algorithm
   primitives must be validated, either separately or as part of the
   same submission.  ACVP provides a mechanism for specifying the
   required prerequisites:

   Prerequisites, if applicable, MUST be submitted in the registration
   as the "prereqVals" JSON property array inside each element of the
   "algorithms" array.  Each element in the "prereqVals" array MUST
   contain the following properties

        +===============+=============================+===========+
        | JSON Property | Description                 | JSON Type |
        +===============+=============================+===========+
        | algorithm     | a prerequisite algorithm    | string    |
        +---------------+-----------------------------+-----------+
        | valValue      | algorithm validation number | string    |
        +---------------+-----------------------------+-----------+

                      Table 1: Prerequisite Properties

   A "valValue" of "same" SHALL be used to indicate that the
   prerequisite is being met by a different algorithm in the capability
   exchange in the same registration.

   An example description of prerequisites within a single algorithm
   capability exchange looks like this

       "valValue": "same"
     }
   ]

             Table 2: Hash Algorithm Capabilities JSON Values

   The value of the algorithm property MUST be one of the elements from
   the list in Section 5.

8.  Test Vectors

   The ACVP server provides test vectors to the ACVP client, which are
   then processed and returned to the ACVP server for validation.  A
   typical ACVP validation test session would require multiple test
   vector sets to be downloaded and processed by the ACVP client.  Each
   test vector set represents an individual algorithm defined during the
   capability exchange.  This section describes the JSON schema for a
   test vector set used with Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) algorithms.

   The test vector set JSON schema is a multi-level hierarchy that
   contains meta data for the entire vector set as well as individual
   test vectors to be processed by the ACVP client.  The following table
   describes the JSON elements at the top level of the hierarchy.

8.1.  Test Groups

   Test vector sets MUST contain one or many test groups, each sharing
   similar properties.  For instance, all test vectors that use the same
   testType would be grouped together.  The testGroups element at the
   top level of the test vector JSON object SHALL be the array of test
   groups.  The Test Group JSON object MUST contain meta-data that
   applies to all test cases within the group.  The following table
   describes the JSON elements that MAY appear from the server in the
   Test Group JSON object:

   All properties described in the previous table MUST appear in the
   prompt file from the server for every testGroup object.

8.2.  Test Case

   Each test group SHALL contain an array of one or more test cases.
   Each test case is a JSON object that represents a single case to be
   processed by the ACVP client.  The following table describes the JSON
   elements for each test case.

8.3.  Test Vector Responses

   After the ACVP client downloads and processes a vector set, it SHALL
   send the response vectors back to the ACVP server within the alloted
   timeframe.  The following table describes the JSON object that
   represents a vector set response.

      |             | schema as defined in Section 8.2 |           |
      +-------------+----------------------------------+-----------+

                 Table 6: Vector Set Response JSON Object

   The testGroup Response section is used to organize the ACVP client
   response in a similar manner to how it receives vectors.  Several
   algorithms SHALL require the client to send back group level
   properties in its response.  This structure helps accommodate that.

12.  Example Test Vectors JSON Object

   The following is an example JSON object for secure hash test vectors
   sent from the ACVP server to the crypto module.  Note the single bit
   message is represented as "80".  This complies with SHA1 and SHA2
   being big-endian by nature.  All hex strings associated with SHA1 and
   SHA2 will be big-endian.
